{% hint style="info" %}
This setup is based on the fact that Caddy will handle the TLS on your behalf. In case you're experiencing ssl related issues, you might want to patch your ingress-nginx-controller to activate the `enable-ssl-passthrough` flag.
{% endhint %}



In case you are running it locally with a non reachable FQDN, you might want to consider adding  `tls internal` on the Caddy config for self-signed certificate.
