# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to CISO Assistant

## A different take on Cyber Security Posture Management

* explicitly decoupling compliance from cyber-security practices implementation
* providing simplified tools for decision-making
* providing capabilities for a program, product, or an organization assessment against standard frameworks
* you can bring your own framework as well using a simplified DSL
* aim to be a one-stop-shop for cyber security management and cover the layers of GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance)

## An open-source GRC tool

CISO Assistant is open source, so you can find our source code on GitHub and implement it yourself or go to our website to request a cloud trial instance. Please read the [full article](https://intuitem.com/we-are-going-open-source/) about the community editions on our blog.
