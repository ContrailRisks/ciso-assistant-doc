# üìÅ Organization

## A folder organization

For Access Control purpose, CISO Assistant data is organized in a tree of folders. Starting from a root folder called Global, it divide into sub-folders called domains. The organization of the tree is not hard-coded, it is entirely determined by configuration. Any object in CISO Assistant is attached to a folder (including folders), either directly or indirectly through a parent object that is attached to a folder.&#x20;

### So, what is a domain?

A domain permits to organize your work depending on your use of CISO Assistant. For example, inside a company, you can create a domain for each department for which you need to carry out a variety of projects, or if you have different customers, you may as well have a domain for each one in order **to delimit your work area**.

#### Utility

A domain is the first thing you create on CISO Assistant. It will **bring together** all objects you need to complete your different projects. Every **role/permission** a user has on a domain **are applicable to all objects/actions** across the domain. It's all about organization, the only technical aspect is access control, and this is achieved by adding the user to the relevant user group.

#### Role assignment

In the first/open source version of CISO Assistant, custom role assignment is not available. So, when you create a domain, user groups concerning this domain are automatically created for each built-in role. All you need to do, is to assign your users to their user groups. To learn more about this, jump to [user-groups.md](user-groups.md "mention").

## Projects&#x20;

Projects are fundamental context objects defined by the entity using CISO Assistant. They are grouped in domains. They will contain all your risk and compliance assessments. Apart from being able to group your various evaluations across the different domains.

There are two specific fields, internal reference and status. Here are the various status options:

* \-- (None)
* Design
* Development
* Production
* End of life
* Dropped

The purpose of a project is at first, it's organizational aspect to solve a problem. But it also makes it possible to improve analytics by breaking them down according to the different assessments, whether for risk or compliance, so as to make your project management more precise and reduce noise.

## User Groups

User groups go hand in hand with domains. they associate permissions with users and define their scope, by being attached to a domain. They follow a simple and consistent RBAC model from a role containing permissions and a domain determining the perimeter. Go to the [user-groups.md](user-groups.md "mention") page for more details.
