## Policy

A policy is a specific type of applied control that consist of a document describing what is expected from some parts of your stakeholders.

Putting your cybersecurity policies in CISO Assistant will make them readlily available for compliance assessments, and will allow you to manage their lifecycle.

## Risk matrix

To perform risk evaluation, CISO Assistant uses a risk matrix that calculates the risk level as a function of the probability and the impact of a scenario.

Risk matrices have to be imported from a library. Use either one provided by default, or define your own matrix with a custom library, as documented in our github repo.

Most often, entities define an official risk matrix that should be used for all risk assessments. But CISO Assistant let you choose your risk matrix for each assessment if you need to use several of them. However, it is not possible to change the risk matrix once the assessment is created.
